# Testing Javascript

we could test a function by running it and logging the result
...but let's modularize the test code, so it doesn't clutter our production code, and we can run it separately. 
...and make it more efficient if we're going to run lots of tests.
...could we make the outputs even more helpful?
Jest handles all this. It has a lot of functionality bundled up, and we just need to learn the syntax to properly use it.
