# Why we Test

### Change is the only constant

It's good to test our code while we're writing it. That helps us formally structure our intentions for a function and check that it works as expected. But the real benefit of these tests is that we keep them around to use later. Because of the need for updates, evolving requirements, and other issues that arise, we will often be revisiting existing code to make changes. And every time we do, there is some risk of introducing new bugs or unintended consequences. Testing is a safety net to help catch problems promptly, lowering the chance that changes we make do not break our software.

### Quality is key

The systems we build typically manage a customer experience or handle important transactions. Small flaws or failures can cause big problems and expenses for the companies that we work for. So code quality is a fundamental goal, and testing plays a pivotal role in maintaining that quality. Having systems that are reliable minimizes expensive problems, so the people in charge have a strong interest in hiring developers that are competent and diligent with quality assurance practices.

### We Do our Best

Nobody is perfect, and we are going to make mistakes. While it's impossible to guarantee flawless code, testing helps to catch and rectify errors early in the development process, preventing them from becoming more significant issues later or slipping through into the live, deployed application.

### Automating the Process

To maintain code quality, we need to test throughout the development lifecycle. But the scale and complexity of modern software projects make routine manual testing impractical and error-prone. Writing tests in a structured format lets us run them quickly and even automate them. Testing rapidly and consistently helps us get quick, constant assessment feedback about our code quality, so we can minimize problems. That makes our bosses happy.
