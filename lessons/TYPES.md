# Types of Testing

There are many types of testing, and some overlap between them. Here are a few key types:

### Smoke Testing

quickly running through the application to spot obvious flaws


### Integration Testing:

checking how parts of our system talk to each other

### System

### Regression Testing

comprehensively using the app with different inputs to trigger bugs if possible. (Selenium is a powerful automation tool for this)
unit testing: isolating a particular function and running it with different inputs to confirm that it behaves correctly (Jest is a robust package that lets us do this quite easily for our JavaScript)



Unit Testing:

Purpose: To test individual units or components of a software to ensure they function correctly.
Scope: Typically focuses on a specific function or module in isolation.
Integration Testing:

Purpose: To test the interactions between integrated components or systems to ensure they work together as expected.
Scope: Involves testing the interfaces and communication between integrated components.
System Testing:

Purpose: To verify that the complete software system meets specified requirements.
Scope: Involves testing the entire system, including interactions between components.
Acceptance Testing:

Purpose: To ensure that the software satisfies the business requirements and is ready for deployment.
Scope: Involves testing the system from the perspective of the end user.
Functional Testing:

Purpose: To verify that the software functions as expected according to the specified requirements.
Scope: Focuses on the functional aspects of the software.
Non-functional Testing:

Purpose: To evaluate non-functional aspects like performance, scalability, usability, and security.
Scope: Involves testing aspects other than the software's primary functions.
Regression Testing:

Purpose: To ensure that new changes or enhancements do not negatively impact existing functionality.
Scope: Involves retesting parts of the software affected by recent changes.
Performance Testing:

Purpose: To assess the responsiveness, speed, and overall performance of a software application under various conditions.
Scope: Involves load testing, stress testing, and other performance-related assessments.
Usability Testing:

Purpose: To evaluate the user-friendliness and overall user experience of the software.
Scope: Focuses on the software's interface, navigation, and ease of use.
Security Testing:

Purpose: To identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software's security mechanisms.
Scope: Involves testing for potential security threats and risks.
Compatibility Testing:

Purpose: To ensure that the software functions correctly across different environments, browsers, and devices.
Scope: Involves testing on various platforms to ensure compatibility.
Smoke Testing:

Purpose: To quickly determine whether the most critical functions of a software application work.
Scope: Involves a preliminary set of tests to verify basic functionality.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

Purpose: To validate whether the software meets the end user's expectations and requirements.
Scope: Typically performed by end users to ensure the software aligns with business needs.
